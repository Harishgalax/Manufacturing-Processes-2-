Introduction
The Automatic Circular Knitting Machine project aims to demonstrate the principles of automated knitting through the use of mechanical components and programming. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the complexities of manufacturing processes.

Project Objectives
To design a functional model of an automatic circular knitting machine.
To integrate various mechanical and electronic components for seamless operation.
To document the entire process from conceptualization to implementation.
Design and Mechanism
The design phase involved selecting appropriate gears, motors, and other mechanical components to achieve the desired knitting pattern and speed. Detailed schematics and CAD drawings are included in the design folder.

Implementation
The implementation phase covers the assembly of the machine, programming the control system, and fine-tuning the mechanisms. All code, wiring diagrams, and assembly instructions can be found in the implementation folder.

Results
This section presents the outcomes of the project, including:

Performance analysis of the knitting machine.
Evaluation of the knitting quality and speed.
Troubleshooting and optimizations made during the project.
Conclusion
Summarizes the projectâ€™s achievements, challenges faced, and the educational value derived from the process.

Future Work
Suggestions for further improvements and potential extensions of the project, such as incorporating advanced automation techniques and expanding the range of knitting patterns.
